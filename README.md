user-friendly interface where they can create easily an estimation for each customer.

For each customer, the worker can enter 6 different service items by selecting the correspondent service name, and enter the
correspondent dimensions. The app will calculate automatically the size and the cost needed for each service (By using formulae
implemented in the app). At the end, the app will also generate the total cost of each estimation. The woker can choose to save
the estimation and check it for references

In summary, the app saves a lot of time for people who work in Landscaping Industry because they don't need to use a pen and a 
piece of paper to record estimation when they are with customers
